# Data Processing

This notebook creates stacked geotiff files of snow cover percent and albedo with projection information for each water year. 
The output rasters include 365/366 layers, one for each day in the water year.

The notebook [Functions_for_means_and_anomalies](https://github.com/MEDSsnowtoday/data_processing/blob/09dfffb756a51a6686bf623b1720730349d87e0d/functions_for_means_and_anomalies.ipynb) was used to create the raster files (stacked geotiffs) that populates data visualizations on the [MEDS Snow Today Shiny Application](https://shiny.snow.ucsb.edu/snow_today_shiny_app/).
