# Data Processing

The notebooks contained within this repository create stacked geotiff files of snow cover percent and albedo for each water year, and include coordinate projection information. The output rasters include 365/366 layers, one for each day in the water year. A water year runs from October 01 to September 30.

The notebook [functions_for_means_and_anomalies](https://github.com/MEDSsnowtoday/data_processing/blob/09dfffb756a51a6686bf623b1720730349d87e0d/functions_for_means_and_anomalies.ipynb) was used to create the raster files (stacked geotiffs) that populate the data visualizations on the [MEDS Snow Today Shiny application](https://shiny.snow.ucsb.edu/snow_today_shiny_app/).
